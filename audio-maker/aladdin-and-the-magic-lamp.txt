There lives a pool boy with his mother. His name is Aladdin. One day, he meets a man. “I’m your uncle. Would you like to work for me?” asks the man. “Oh, yes.” says Aladdin.

Oh, no! The man is a bad magician. The magician takes Aladdin to the hill. He makes a fire. Then he throws a magic powder on it. He says some magic words, too. Pop! A flat and round stone appears!

Below the stone, Aladdin sees a small hole. “Go down to the hole. There you will see a room of gold,” says the magician. “Go through the room. Then you will see a garden. There is a lamp in the garden. Bring it to me! Put this ring on your finger.”

Aladdin goes down and finds the lamp in the garden. He comes back to the entrance. “Give me the lamp!” says the magician. “Let me out first!” says Aladdin. The magician gets angry. He blocks the hole and goes away. 

Aladdin is alone. He is scared and he is cold. So he rubs his hands. Then he happens to rub the ring. Pop! A big genie appears! This is a surprise!. “I‘m the genie of the ring! What can I do for you?” he says. “Take me home!” Aladdin says.

Soon Aladdin is at home. His mother sees him with the lamp. “What’s that lamp? It is old and dirty. Let me clean it,” she says. She rubs the lamp. Pop! A big genie comes out of the lamp! This is a surprise!

”I’m the genie of the lamp. What can I do for you?” “I want to be rich. I want a great house, too,” says Aladdin. “You can have hem,” says the genie. Aladdin and his mother become rich.

Many years passed. Aladdin is a handsome young man now. One day he goes to the town. There he sees the Princess. “Oh, she is very beautiful,” says Aladdin. He falls in love with her. He wants to marry her.

Aladdin goes to the King. “I want to marry the Princess,” he says. “Bring me 40 servants with 40 bowls of jewels. And build a golden palace next to mine. Then you can marry her,” says the king. Aladdin goes back home and he rubs the lamp. He asks the genie for help.

The next day Aladdin goes to the King. Aladdin shows everything to the King. “Great! You can marry the Princess,” says the King. Aladdin and the Princess get married. They live in the golden palace.

The bad magician hears of Aladdin. “Aladdin married the Princess. And he is very rich,” he shouts. “The genie of the lamp did all these things. I must get it back!”

The magician goes to Aladdin’s palace. “New lamps for old lamps!” he says. “My husband has an old and dirty lamp. I want a new lamp,” says the Princess. She gives the magic lamp to the magician.

“Aha! Now I have the magic lamp!” says the magician. He rubs the lamp. The genie comes out of it! “Take away the palace and the Princess,” says the magician. “Yes, sir.”

Aladdin comes back. He is very surprised. His palace is gone! The Princess is gone, too! “Where is the Princess?” shouts the King. “Find her, or you will die.”

“What can I do?” says Aladdin. Then he remembers the ring. He rubs the ring. “Take me to my palace and my wife. Quick!”

Soon Aladdin is in his palace. “On, Aladdin,” says the Princess. She tells him everything. “The magician keeps the lamp with him,” says the Princess. “Be kind to him. Give him a drink tonight,” says Aladdin.

The magician comes to the Princess that night. “Let’s drink together,” says the Princess. She puts some sleeping powder in his cup. “Cheers!” The magician drinks it and falls asleep.

Aladdin gets the lamp again. He rubs it. “Take my wife, me, and the palace back, and I don’t want to see the magician again!”, says Aladdin. Soon they are back. Aladdin is happy now. They live happily ever after.
